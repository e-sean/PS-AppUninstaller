# PS-AppUninstaller

**PowerShell toolkit to safely uninstall Windows apps with batch support, detailed logging, and exit code tracking for endpoint management solutions like SCCM/MECM and Intune.**

---

## üìã Overview

`PS-AppUninstaller` is a PowerShell toolkit built for IT admins and endpoint engineers who want a **transparent, automation‚Äëready way to remove Windows applications**.  
It‚Äôs designed with enterprise workflows in mind: batch execution, audit‚Äëfriendly logs, and standardized exit codes that SCCM/MECM, Intune, and other management platforms can readily interpret.

Where this tool really shines:
- Removing rogue software that didn‚Äôt originate from an approved package  
- Cleaning up when a vendor‚Äôs MSI/EXE fails to fully uninstall  
- Removing corrupted installs where the `UninstallString` is no longer valid  
- Retiring software cleanly from the environment  
- Addressing Nexpose findings where vulnerabilities are flagged against partially‚Äëinstalled software  

Key capabilities include:
- **Batch operations** via JSON configuration files  
- **Detailed transcript logging** for audit trails  
- **Standardized exit codes** for management software compatibility  
- **Support for multiple uninstall types**: MSI, EXE, AppX/MSIX, and App‚ÄëV  
- **Optional post‚Äëuninstall cleanup**: shortcuts, registry keys, files, environment variables, PATH entries, scheduled tasks, services, certificates, and WMI  
- **Uninstall catalog**: a limited set of ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse uninstall ‚Äúrecipes,‚Äù such as a full MECM client removal (useful when the client is corrupt and traditional repair/reinstall options don‚Äôt work)  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- Testing so far has been limited to personal Windows 11 environments. While the toolkit is structured for enterprise scenarios, validate carefully in lab or pilot settings before broad deployment.  
- App‚ÄëV support is included in code but has **not yet been tested**. Evaluation on Windows 11 Enterprise is planned.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/e-sean/PS-AppUninstaller.git
   cd PS-AppUninstaller
   ```
   Or download the ZIP, extract, and navigate to it.

2. Launch the script with -WhatIf to validate your -Name pattern. You may use wildcards `*` in your -Name pattern
   ```powershell
   .\Remove-App.ps1 -Name "*chrome*" -LN "Uninstall_GoogleChrome.log" -WhatIf
   ```
3. Refine your -Name pattern to make sure you're targeting the exact application you want removed. Populate any other parameters as needed and validate with another -WhatIf run
   ```powershell
   .\Remove-App.ps1 -Name "Google Chrome" -PN "chrome" -RA "/qn /norestart" -LN "Uninstall_GoogleChrome.log" -WhatIf
   ```
4. After validating the output, you're ready to test the removal with -WhatIf omitted.
   
5. Once you have successfully tested the removal, you can add this to an SCCM/MECM application, Intune package, or other endpoint manaagement solution.

### Examples:
  Validate a match in ARP (Programs and Features) and preview uninstall:
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Name "*chrome*" -WhatIf
  ```
  
  Uninstall a single application registered in Programs and Features with all settings 
  contained in command line:
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Name "Google Chrome" -AR "/qn /norestart" -LN GoogleChrome_Uninstall.log
  ```
  
  Uninstall a single AppX/MSIX application and stop process(es) with all settings contained in command line:
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Name "Spotify*" -PN "spotify" -LN Spotify_Uninstall.log -AppX
  ```

  Uninstall one or more application(s) with all settings contained in JSON:
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -ConfigPath .\Google_Chrome.json
  ```

  Use a catalog uninstall:
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Catalog List
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Catalog "Chrome_Enterprise" -LN GoogleChrome_Enterprise_Uninstall.log
  ```

  Run a catalog cleanup only (skip uninstall):
  ```powershell
  .\Remove-App.ps1 -Catalog "Chrome_StandaloneUser" -LN GoogleChrome_StandaloneUser_Uninstall.log -SU -CleanupPolicy Always
  ```
